The project can be executed from running UI.py, and the database is cleared for each run for demo purposes.

The Shuffler Gamification VR Health Tracker By Nik Bin Nik Nahran Nik Mohd Amir, Lachlan Lai, Haocheng Xu, Aowei Zhang

This project aims at providing consumers with a tool that encourages the simulation of virtual walking at home. The product is a mechanized device that attaches to the consumer and acts as automated walking guide that mimics walking while sitting down. Effectively, the consumer can achieve walking targets whilst in the comfort of their own home. This product potentially promotes public health, helps people being productive and persist in exercising.

Hardware: 
The pedometers, bonded to patients’ feet, detect the increments of steps, and the number of steps is recorded in the software. Users can set a daily goal, and they will be positively reinforced if they reach their goals. The system can also record pulse rate, etc.
A VR/AR device, which can be affordably implemented by using the user’s phone as a VR view alongside a cardboard VR cutout, like Google’s Cardboard.
Elastic bands that bond users’ legs to the chair to simulate resistance, uphill and downhill.

Software:
Visuals for a walk: an immersive experience, boosted by VR equipment, of walking anywhere you want.
Display of health data collected.
Warning for abnormalty.

User Interface: 
Including today’s goal, current progress, immediate positive feedback when the goal is reached, time schedule (e.g. 18:00, 30-min walk), all health data collected (pulse rate, etc.), and customized health suggestions based on the analyzation. Analysis of data can be seen in a non-VR mode, specified for easier access.

Target audience: Elderly folk with lack of ability to walk, recovering patients in physical therapy (NHS issues?), sedentary individuals with not much incentive to be active
The end-goal objective is to be able to develop a VR/AR app for users to immerse themselves in various everyday walking scenarios. The idea is for sedentary/unable consumers to experience walking from a stationary position. The app can be implemented with the heartbeat and step count sensors as activity trackers.
